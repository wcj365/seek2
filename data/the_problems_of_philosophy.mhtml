 that the sun is about ninety-three million miles from the earth; that it i=

rotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an indefin=

to my room, he will see the same chairs and tables and books and papers as =
I see, and that the table which I see is the same as the table which I feel=
 pressing against my arm. All this seems to be so evident as to be hardly w=

the table will agree with this description, so that it might seem as if no =

 if I move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the=
 apparent distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows that=
 if several people are looking at the table at the same moment, no two of t=

 things, and we do this so unreflectingly that we come to think we actually=

aw, a given thing looks different in shape from every different point of vi=
ew. If our table is 'really' rectangular, it will look, from almost all poi=
nts of view, as if it had two acute angles and two obtuse angles. If opposi=
te sides are parallel, they will look as if they converged to a point away =
from the spectator; if they are of equal length, they will look as if the n=
earer side were longer. All these things are not commonly noticed in lookin=
g at a table, because experience has taught us to construct the 'real' shap=
e from the apparent shape, and the 'real' shape is what interests us as pra=
ctical men. But the 'real' shape is not what we see; it is something inferr=

 by the medium intervening between us and the object, as well as by the man=
ner in which light is reflected from the object in the direction of the eye=
. The intervening air alters colours unless it is perfectly clear, and any =
strong reflection will alter them completely. Thus the colour we see is a r=
esult of the ray as it reaches the eye, and not simply a property of the ob=
ject from which the ray comes. Hence, also, provided certain waves reach th=
e eye, we shall see a certain colour, whether the object from which the wav=

Berkeley contended) ideas in the minds which, as we should commonly say, 'p=

st continue to exist even when we shut our eyes or when no human being is n=
ear it. But this continued existence, he says, is due to the fact that God =
continues to perceive it; the 'real' tree, which corresponds to what we cal=
led the physical object, consists of ideas in the mind of God, ideas more o=
r less like those we have when we see the tree, but differing in the fact t=
hat they are permanent in God's mind so long as the tree continues to exist=
. All our perceptions, according to him, consist in a partial participation=
 in God's perceptions, and it is because of this participation that differe=

ent a good many fallacies which have been important in the history of philo=
sophy, and which it will be as well to bring to light. In the first place, =
there is a confusion engendered by the use of the word 'idea'. We think of =
an idea as essentially something in somebody's mind, and thus when we are t=
old that a tree consists entirely of ideas, it is natural to suppose that, =
if so, the tree must be entirely in minds. But the notion of being 'in' the=
 mind is ambiguous. We speak of bearing a person in mind, not meaning that =
the person is in our minds, but that a thought of him is in our minds. When=
 a man says that some business he had to arrange went clean out of his mind=
, he does not mean to imply that the business itself was ever in his mind, =
but only that a thought of the business was formerly in his mind, but after=
wards ceased to be in his mind. And so when Berkeley says that the tree mus=
t be in our minds if we can know it, all that he really has a right to say =
is that a thought of the tree must be in our minds. To argue that the tree =
itself must be in our minds is like arguing that a person whom we bear in m=
ind is himself in our minds. This confusion may seem too gross to have been=
 really committed by any competent philosopher, but various attendant circu=
mstances rendered it possible. In order to see how it was possible, we must=

 The faculty of being acquainted with things other than itself is the main =

 a relation between the mind and something other than the mind; it is this =
that constitutes the mind's power of knowing things. If we say that the thi=

answer to this inquiry, many metaphysical results as to the nature of the w=

 I say, 'A bald man is a man', 'A plane figure is a figure', 'A bad poet is=
 a poet', I make a purely analytic judgement: the subject spoken about is g=
iven as having at least two properties, of which one is singled out to be a=
sserted of it. Such propositions as the above are trivial, and would never =
be enunciated in real life except by an orator preparing the way for a piec=

o proceed by considering this, that, and the other just act, with a view to=
 discovering what they have in common. They must all, in some sense, partak=
e of a common nature, which will be found in whatever is just and in nothin=

ustice itself, the pure essence the admixture of which with facts of ordina=
ry life produces the multiplicity of just acts. Similarly with any other wo=
rd which may be applicable to common facts, such as 'whiteness' for example=
. The word will be applicable to a number of particular things because they=
 all participate in a common nature or essence. This pure essence is what P=
lato calls an 'idea' or 'form'. (It must not be supposed that 'ideas', in h=
is sense, exist in minds, though they may be apprehended by minds.) The 'id=
ea' <span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;i&gt;</span>justice<span class=3D"html-tag=

thing other than particular things, which particular things partake of. Not=

it is easy to pass on into a mysticism. We may hope, in a mystic illuminati=

 dwell upon a word which stands for a universal, we naturally think of it a=
s standing for some one of the particulars that come under the universal. W=

ost metaphysics, since Spinoza, has been largely determined by it. The way =
this has occurred is, in outline, as follows: Speaking generally, adjective=
s and common nouns express qualities or properties of single things, wherea=
s prepositions and verbs tend to express relations between two or more thin=
gs. Thus the neglect of prepositions and verbs led to the belief that every=
 proposition can be regarded as attributing a property to a single thing, r=
ather than as expressing a relation between two or more things. Hence it wa=
s supposed that, ultimately, there can be no such entities as relations bet=
ween things. Hence either there can be only one thing in the universe, or, =

use they have the quality of whiteness. This view, however, was strenuously=
 denied by Berkeley and Hume, who have been followed in this by later empir=
icists. The form which their denial took was to deny that there are such th=
ings as 'abstract ideas '. When we want to think of whiteness, they said, w=
e form an image of some particular white thing, and reason concerning this =
particular, taking care not to deduce anything concerning it which we canno=
t see to be equally true of any other white thing. As an account of our act=
ual mental processes, this is no doubt largely true. In geometry, for examp=
le, when we wish to prove something about all triangles, we draw a particul=
ar triangle and reason about it, taking care not to use any characteristic =
which it does not share with other triangles. The beginner, in order to avo=
id error, often finds it useful to draw several triangles, as unlike each o=
ther as possible, in order to make sure that his reasoning is equally appli=
cable to all of them. But a difficulty emerges as soon as we ask ourselves =
how we know that a thing is white or a triangle. If we wish to avoid the un=
iversals <span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;i&gt;</span>whiteness<span class=3D"h=

angularity<span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>, we shall choose some =
particular patch of white or some particular triangle, and say that anythin=
g is white or a triangle if it has the right sort of resemblance to our cho=
sen particular. But then the resemblance required will have to be a univers=
al. Since there are many white things, the resemblance must hold between ma=
ny pairs of particular white things; and this is the characteristic of a un=
iversal. It will be useless to say that there is a different resemblance fo=
r each pair, for then we shall have to say that these resemblances resemble=
 each other, and thus at last we shall be forced to admit resemblance as a =
universal. The relation of resemblance, therefore, must be a true universal=
. And having been forced to admit this universal, we find that it is no lon=

his word, namely the sense in which it denotes the <span class=3D"html-tag"=

a. When we see a white patch, we are acquainted, in the first instance, wit=

o abstract the whiteness which they all have in common, and in learning to =
do this we are learning to be acquainted with whiteness. A similar process =
will make us acquainted with any other universal of the same sort. Universa=
ls of this sort may be called 'sensible qualities'. They can be apprehended=
 with less effort of abstraction than any others, and they seem less remove=

lance the whole of the page on which I am writing; thus the whole page is i=
ncluded in one sense-datum. But I perceive that some parts of the page are =
to the left of other parts, and some parts are above other parts. The proce=

successively a number of sense-data in which one part is to the left of ano=
ther; I perceive, as in the case of different white patches, that all these=
 sense-data have something in common, and by abstraction I find that what t=
hey have in common is a certain relation between their parts, namely the re=

 day, I find things of which I am quite certain, other things of which I am=
 almost certain, other things of which I can become certain by thought and =
by calling up attendant circumstances, and some things of which I am by no =
means certain. I am quite certain that I ate my breakfast this morning, but=

it easily, some with an effort, some only with a large element of doubt, an=

 When Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio, he must not have before=
 his mind a single object, 'Desdemona's love for Cassio', or 'that Desdemon=
a loves Cassio ', for that would require that there should be objective fal=
sehoods, which subsist independently of any minds; and this, though not log=
ically refutable, is a theory to be avoided if possible. Thus it is easier =
to account for falsehood if we take judgement to be a relation in which the=
 mind and the various objects concerned all occur severally; that is to say=
, Desdemona and loving and Cassio must all be terms in the relation which s=
ubsists when Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio. This relation, t=
herefore, is a relation of four terms, since Othello also is one of the ter=
ms of the relation. When we say that it is a relation of four terms, we do =
not mean that Othello has a certain relation to Desdemona, and has the same=
 relation to loving and also to Cassio. This may be true of some other rela=
tion than believing; but believing, plainly, is not a relation which Othell=
o has to <span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;i&gt;</span>each<span class=3D"html-t=

tml-tag">&lt;i&gt;</span>all<span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span> of t=
hem together: there is only one example of the relation of believing involv=
ed, but this one example knits together four terms. Thus the actual occurre=
nce, at the moment when Othello is entertaining his belief, is that the rel=
ation called 'believing' is knitting together into one complex whole the fo=
ur terms Othello, Desdemona, loving, and Cassio. What is called belief or j=
udgement is nothing but this relation of believing or judging, which relate=
s a mind to several things other than itself. An <span class=3D"html-tag">&=
lt;i&gt;</span>act<span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span> of belief or o=

n to understand what it is that distinguishes a true judgement from a false=
 one. For this purpose we will adopt certain definitions. In every act of j=
udgement there is a mind which judges, and there are terms concerning which=
 it judges. We will call the mind the <span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;i&gt;</s=
pan>subject<span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span> in the judgement, and=
 the remaining terms the <span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;i&gt;</span>objects<s=
pan class=3D"html-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>. Thus, when Othello judges that De=
sdemona loves Cassio, Othello is the subject, while the objects are Desdemo=

he <span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;i&gt;</span>constituents<span class=3D"html=
-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span> of the judgement. It will be observed that the rela=

taphorically, that it puts its objects in a certain <span class=3D"html-tag=
">&lt;i&gt;</span>order<span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>, which we=
 may indicate by means of the order of the words in the sentence. (In an in=
flected language, the same thing will be indicated by inflections, e.g. by =
the difference between nominative and accusative.) Othello's judgement that=
 Cassio loves Desdemona differs from his judgement that Desdemona loves Cas=
sio, in spite of the fact that it consists of the same constituents, becaus=
e the relation of judging places the constituents in a different order in t=
he two cases. Similarly, if Cassio judges that Desdemona loves Othello, the=
 constituents of the judgement are still the same, but their order is diffe=
rent. This property of having a 'sense' or 'direction' is one which the rel=
ation of judging shares with all other relations. The 'sense' of relations =
is the ultimate source of order and series and a host of mathematical conce=

n called 'judging' or 'believing' as knitting together into one complex who=
le the subject and the objects. In this respect, judging is exactly like ev=
ery other relation. Whenever a relation holds between two or more terms, it=
 unites the terms into a complex whole. If Othello loves Desdemona, there i=
s such a complex whole as 'Othello's love for Desdemona'. The terms united =
by the relation may be themselves complex, or may be simple, but the whole =
which results from their being united must be complex. Wherever there is a =
relation which relates certain terms, there is a complex object formed of t=
he union of those terms; and conversely, wherever there is a complex object=
, there is a relation which relates its constituents. When an act of believ=
ing occurs, there is a complex, in which 'believing' is the uniting relatio=
n, and subject and objects are arranged in a certain order by the 'sense' o=
f the relation of believing. Among the objects, as we saw in considering 'O=
thello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio', one must be a relation=E2=80=
=94in this instance, the relation 'loving'. But this relation, as it occurs=
 in the act of believing, is not the relation which creates the unity of th=
e complex whole consisting of the subject and the objects. The relation 'lo=
ving', as it occurs in the act of believing, is one of the objects=E2=80=94=
it is a brick in the structure, not the cement. The cement is the relation =
'believing'. When the belief is <span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;i&gt;</span>tr=
ue<span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>, there is another complex unit=
y, in which the relation which was one of the objects of the belief relates=
 the other objects. Thus, e.g., if Othello believes <span class=3D"html-tag=
">&lt;i&gt;</span>truly<span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span> that Desd=
emona loves Cassio, then there is a complex unity, 'Desdemona's love for Ca=

in the same order as they had in the belief, with the relation which was on=

objects of the belief. On the other hand, when a belief is <span class=3D"h=

here is no such complex unity composed only of the objects of the belief. I=

e, in modern times, of the kind of view which we wish to examine, was Hegel=
 (1770-1831). Hegel's philosophy is very difficult, and commentators differ=
 as to the true interpretation of it. According to the interpretation I sha=
ll adopt, which is that of many, if not most, of the commentators and has t=
he merit of giving an interesting and important type of philosophy, his mai=
n thesis is that everything short of the Whole is obviously fragmentary, an=
d obviously incapable of existing without the complement supplied by the re=
st of the world. Just as a comparative anatomist, from a single bone, sees =
what kind of animal the whole must have been, so the metaphysician, accordi=
ng to Hegel, sees, from any one piece of reality, what the whole of reality=
 must be=E2=80=94at least in its large outlines. Every apparently separate =
piece of reality has, as it were, hooks which grapple it to the next piece;=
 the next piece, in turn, has fresh hooks, and so on, until the whole unive=
rse is reconstructed. This essential incompleteness appears, according to H=
egel, equally in the world of thought and in the world of things. In the wo=
rld of thought, if we take any idea which is abstract or incomplete, we fin=
d, on examination, that if we forget its incompleteness, we become involved=
 in contradictions; these contradictions turn the idea in question into its=
 opposite, or antithesis; and in order to escape, we have to find a new, le=
ss incomplete idea, which is the synthesis of our original idea and its ant=
ithesis. This new idea, though less incomplete than the idea we started wit=
h, will be found, nevertheless, to be still not wholly complete, but to pas=
s into its antithesis, with which it must be combined in a new synthesis. I=
n this way Hegel advances until he reaches the 'Absolute Idea', which, acco=
rding to him, has no incompleteness, no opposite, and no need of further de=
velopment. The Absolute Idea, therefore, is adequate to describe Absolute R=
eality; but all lower ideas only describe reality as it appears to a partia=
l view, not as it is to one who simultaneously surveys the Whole. Thus Hege=
l reaches the conclusion that Absolute Reality forms one single harmonious =
system, not in space or time, not in any degree evil, wholly rational, and =
wholly spiritual. Any appearance to the contrary, in the world we know, can=
 be proved logically=E2=80=94so he believes=E2=80=94to be entirely due to o=
ur fragmentary piecemeal view of the universe. If we saw the universe whole=
, as we may suppose God sees it, space and time and matter and evil and all=
 striving and struggling would disappear, and we should see instead an eter=
nal perfect unchanging spiritual unity.<span class=3D"html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;<=

other things before it can exist. It is held that whatever has relations to=
 things outside itself must contain some reference to those outside things =

her thing did not subsist. But a truth about a thing is not part of the thi=

 the thing, then plainly we cannot know a thing's 'nature' unless we know a=
ll the thing's relations to all the other things in the universe. But if th=
e word 'nature' is used in this sense, we shall have to hold that the thing=
 may be known when its 'nature' is not known, or at any rate is not known c=

t it=E2=80=94theoretically we need not know any propositions about it. Thus=

 above sense, is not involved. Hence, (1) acquaintance with a thing does no=

relations does not prove that its relations are logically necessary. That i=

mmon sense, and to show the possibility of spaces differing=E2=80=94some mo=
re, some less=E2=80=94from that in which we live. And some of these spaces =
differ so little from Euclidean space, where distances such as we can measu=
re are concerned, that it is impossible to discover by observation whether =
our actual space is strictly Euclidean or of one of these other kinds. Thus=
 the position is completely reversed. Formerly it appeared that experience =
left only one kind of space to logic, and logic showed this one kind to be =
impossible. Now, logic presents many kinds of space as possible apart from =
experience, and experience only partially decides between them. Thus, while=
 our knowledge of what is has become less than it was formerly supposed to =
be, our knowledge of what may be is enormously increased. Instead of being =
shut in within narrow walls, of which every nook and cranny could be explor=
ed, we find ourselves in an open world of free possibilities, where much re=
mains unknown because there is so much to know.<span class=3D"html-tag">&lt=

resenting innumerable alternatives which are closed to unreflective common =

ilosophy has had any very great measure of success in its attempts to provi=

 he will, if he is candid, have to confess that his study has not achieved =
positive results such as have been achieved by other sciences. It is true t=

hology. Thus, to a great extent, the uncertainty of philosophy is more appa=
rent than real: those questions which are already capable of definite answe=
